Bonus part

Evaluate the bonus part if, and only if, the mandatory part has been entirely and perfectly done, and the error management handles unexpected or bad usage. In case all the mandatory points were not passed during the defense, bonus points must be totally ignored.
Simple flags management

    Check the flags '.', '-' and 0.
    Check the %-d with INT_MIN
    Check the - flag with any value.
    Check the 0 flag like %04d.
    Check the '.' with multiple precisions.
    For every test, verify the return value matches the original one.
    For each working flag, give 1 point.
    If all the flags work, give 2 bonus points.

Rate it from 0 (failed) through 5 (excellent)
# + space

    Check all the conversions with the flags '#', '+' and space with all the other flag combinations.
    For each working flag, give 1 point.
    If all the flags work, give 2 bonus points.
